/*
   Para que nÆo fosse necess rio criar um novo programa em fun‡Æo dos novos campos
   na temp-table de integra‡Æo, fizemos o seguinte tratamento:

   EMS5                                   EMS2
   ------------------------               ----------------------
   tt_emitente_integr_new(Antiga TT)  =>  tt_emitente_integr_OLD
   tt_emitente_integr_new_1(Nova TT)  =>  tt_emitente_integr_new

   Dessa maneira nÆo foi preciso criar um novo programa e muito menos alterar todo
   o c¢digo do atual para substituir o nome da temp-table.
