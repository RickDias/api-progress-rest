/*
   Para que n�o fosse necess�rio criar um novo programa em fun��o dos novos campos
   na temp-table de integra��o, fizemos o seguinte tratamento:

   EMS5                                   EMS2
   ------------------------               ----------------------
   tt_emitente_integr_new(Antiga TT)  =>  tt_emitente_integr_OLD
   tt_emitente_integr_new_1(Nova TT)  =>  tt_emitente_integr_new

   Dessa maneira n�o foi preciso criar um novo programa e muito menos alterar todo
   o c�digo do atual para substituir o nome da temp-table.
